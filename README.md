# PALMORA-GROUP-HR-ANALYSIS-DSA-PROJECT
This is my second project after my Data Analysis classes at Digital Skillup Africa , Incubator Hub

### Project Overview 
Palmora Group is a manufacturing company based in Nigeria. They have been tagged in a News headline as a company with gender  inequality . This is bad for the companies revenue. As an analyst I was brought on board  to analyse issues of gender inequality in its 3 regions.
By analysing the various parameters in the data received, I seek to gather enough insights to identify key areas that the company needs to address immediately, find out the reason for the gender inequality news headline and how to prevent further bad news reports on gender inequality in Palmora Group.
